Welcome, Bonjour, and Moin! With the content on [68Keys.io][1], you can build your own custom 68% Mechanical Keyboard! Sounds great, right? You will find all information about the needed [Circuit Board][2], [Aluminium Case][3], and modified [TMK firmware][4] on this site. With the detailed shopping list, you can start ordering parts and dive into building your own mechanical keyboard right away. Have fun!

Being an enthusiast for mechanical keyboards, I switched to 60% keyboards from [KBParadise][5] a while ago. I never regretted this decision, but all the time I had an eye on a beauty called [Varmilo VA87M][6]. When I read about the terrible macOS support, I was truely disappointed and started to read about building a custom keyboard.

### How To Use This Guide?

The content on this site is split up into three parts. Together with the [shopping list][7] you have all you need to start building your own mechanical keyboard:

- [Aluminium Case][3]\
  <span>Simple, unexpensive, but beautiful *Sandwich Case* made of Aluminium.</span>
- [Printed Circuit Boards][2]\
  <span>Custom Printed Circuit Boards using an Arduino with ATmega32U4.</span>
- [TMK Firmware][4]\
  <span>Customizable keyboard firmware based on the popular TMK firmware.</span>

If you are ready to tackle this adventure, head over to the [shopping list][7] and start ordering! When you received everything, start with building the [Aluminium Case][3] first, followed by soldering everything to the [Circuit Board][2], and finally load the [TMK Firmware][4] to your board!

### Requirements

I expect you already have a couple of things, most noteable a screw driver and a soldering iron. The needed screw driver depends on the type of screws you chose for the case, and I cannot recommand any specific soldering Iron. I ordered an inexpensive one on Amazon a couple of years ago.

### License

This guide is published using the [BY-NC-SA Creative Commons][8] license and you can use all information and resources free of charge. However, I would love to hear your [feedback on twitter][9]!

All sources are available on [GitHub][10], please submit a [Pull Request][11] or file an [Issue][12] if you notice something strange on these pages.

### Thank You!

All this content would not exist without the great resources about mechanical keyboards already available online. Most noteable the [Keyboard Layout Editor][13], [Keyboard Case Builder][14], [Gerber files for the PCB][15], [TMK firmware][16], and many more.

A huge applause goes to [Hauke][17] for hooking me up with mechanical keyboards, my colleagues at the office that suffer from the clicky noise, and [Julia][18] for all the awesome photos. You guys are the best! ðŸ˜˜
